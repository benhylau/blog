Before [34c3](https://events.ccc.de/congress/2017/wiki/index.php/Main_Page) this year I visited
Malmö for a couple of hours. And while I was there I managed to squeeze in a visit to the Xil.se
hackerspace.

They have the most anonymous entrance I have ever seen, but after some guidance over the phone
I managed to find it.

They are located in a residential part of Malmö, but are close to both public transports and some
restaurants.

The space is located in a basement, and they are working on renovating it, but the places
that they have finished are cosy.

They do a lot of hardware and soldering, so most of the space is optimized for that.

Having a microscope makes it super easy to solder tiny parts.

The other rooms are not as furnished, but at least they managed to get some servers up

And 3d-printers and games.

When they don't do hardware, they play a lot of [ctf's](https://ctftime.org/team/21671) and
we have played a few events together.

We are looking forward towards visiting when it's not in the middle of winter.
